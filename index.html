      <div class="about-me">
        <p>HELLO, MY NAME IS VALERIE. I am a fullstack web developer and an engineer. The first time I coded was in 2006 on Matlab, while I was in preparatory classes for engineer schools. Since then, programming has kept waving at me (statistics on R in engineer school, projects on VBA and SQL during internships).</p>
        <p>After finishing Le Wagon FullStack bootcamp in 2019, I decided to push it further by following the Code&Go bootcamp at EPITECH.</p>
        <p>I always work with a growth mindset which allows me to see difficulties as challenges, I am a fast learner, driven by great team work, emphatic and determined colleagues and the satisfaction you get after having spent energy on a clean and DRY code that works!</p>
